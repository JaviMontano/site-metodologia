# Changelog

Significant decisions, completions, and changes across sessions.

## 2026-03-23

- **[amendment]**: Constitution v5.1.0 — added XVIII (Indexable & Self-Organizing Repository), Workspace section, gitignore governance. [XVIII, XII]
- **[decision]**: `estandares/` moved to `workspace/estandares/` — internal references are not repo content, they're user interaction material. Removed from git tracking. [XVIII]
- **[decision]**: `workspace/` gitignored with comment — user interaction layer stays local. Tasks bridge (`workspace/tasks/`) connects tasklog.md to working files. [XVIII]
- **[amendment]**: Constitution v5.0.0 — added XVII (Continuous Learning Loop), Session Protocol, Operational Logs, Insights System. Structural evolution for cross-session scalability. [XVII, XIII, XV]
- **[amendment]**: Constitution v4.1.0 — codified sanitization default (VII), runner-agnostic BDD (XV), dual-layer verification (VII) from Socratic debates. [VII, XV, XIV]
- **[insight]**: Created `insights/` system with 5 domain files, 13 total insights extracted from 3 Socratic debates. [XVII]
- **[decision]**: TS-024 — HTML sanitization strategy: strip (not escape, not allowlist). DOMParser native, zero dependencies. [VII, XIV]
- **[decision]**: TS-022/TS-040 — static invariant verification: hybrid strategy. Playwright for browser-inspectable (TS-022), Vitest for code-scan (TS-040). Runner matches nature. [XV, VII]
- **[decision]**: TS-020 — audit log verification: Emulator integration test. Qualified field paths required (e.g., `programs/diagnostico.description_es`). UX confirmation gap detected. [VII, XV, FR-011]
